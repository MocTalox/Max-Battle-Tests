## Attack verification tests

Health: [51/172 hp (121 dmg)](../../res/raikou_01.png)

```python
>>> 0.5 * 100 * ((241 + 15) * 1.6) / ((228 + 15) * 0.8403) * 1.2
120.35678027982362
>>> floor(_) + 1
121
```

> Using `AtkCPM = 1.6`, the damage **is correct!**

```

> Using `AtkCPM = 1.6`, the damage **is correct!**

## HP tests

*Note: No proper HP tests were done this time. The HP value of `25000` was obtained directly from [Defense verification tests](#defense-verification-tests), which was the only "decently pretty" value that fulfilled the tests done on that section. This was the same aproach used on early HP testing.*

## Defense verification tests

**[Lvl1 03/02/11 Skwovet](../../res/skwovet_01.png), Unknown Weather, 10 helpers** ([battle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx2BZbJY50))

Attacks damage:
- Bite: `1` dmg

*Note: Having weather boost does not affect the following maths.*

```python
>>> 0.5 * 6 * ((95 + 3) * 0.094) / ((195 + 15) * 0.8) * 1.195
0.19657750000000002
>>> floor(_) + 1
1
```

Segments sequence:
- Segment #1:
  - 250 Bite

```python
>>> from src.max_utils import segPrint as s
>>> s(250 * 1, 250)
Seg: 1 | Extra: 0 dmg | Total: 250 dmg
```

> Using `DefCPM = 0.8` and `250` HP per segment, the damage **is correct!**
