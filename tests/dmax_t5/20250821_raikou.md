## HP tests

> 🛠️ Dev note: No proper HP tests were done this time. The HP value of `25000` was obtained directly from [Defense verification tests](#defense-verification-tests), which was the only *decently pretty* value that fulfilled the tests done on that section. This was the same aproach used on early HP testing.

## Defense verification tests
