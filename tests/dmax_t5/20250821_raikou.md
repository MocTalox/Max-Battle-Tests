# Raikou

Raikou was available in T5 Dynamax Battles on August 21st and 22nd globaly during the *PokÃ©mon GO: Dark Skies* event and on August 23rd and 24th globaly during the *Go Fest: Max Finale* event.

## Result

Raikou has the same CPM as [last time](./20250315_raikou.md.md), but it got an HP buff, from `20k` to `25k`:

- HP: `25000`
- CPM: `0.8`
- AtkMult: `2.0`
- DefMult: `1.0`
- AtkCPM: `1.6`
- DefCPM: `0.8`

## Attack verification tests

**Spread NWB Thunder vs Lvl50 15/15/15 Metagross**

Health: [51/172 hp (121 dmg)](../../res/metagross_01.png)

```python
>>> 0.5 * 100 * ((241 + 15) * 1.6) / ((228 + 15) * 0.8403) * 1.2
120.35678027982362
>>> floor(_) + 1
121
```

> Using `AtkCPM = 1.6`, the damage **is correct!**

**Spread NWB Thunder vs Lvl27 13/15/13 Excadrill**

Health: [80/177 hp (97 dmg)](../../res/excadrill_01.png)

```python
>>> 0.5 * 100 * ((241 + 15) * 1.6) / ((129 + 15) * 0.694143653) * 1.2 * 0.390625
96.04159942764277
>>> floor(_) + 1
97
```

> Using `AtkCPM = 1.6`, the damage **is correct!**

## HP tests

*Note: No proper HP tests were done this time. The HP value was obtained directly from [Defense verification tests](#defense-verification-tests), which was the only "decently pretty" value that fulfilled the tests done on that section. This was the same aproach used on early HP testing.*

## Defense verification tests

**[Lvl1 03/02/11 Skwovet](../../res/skwovet_01.png), Unknown Weather, 10 helpers** ([battle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx2BZbJY50))

Attacks damage:
- Bite: `1` dmg

*Note: Having weather boost does not affect the following maths.*

```python
>>> 0.5 * 6 * ((95 + 3) * 0.094) / ((195 + 15) * 0.8) * 1.195
0.19657750000000002
>>> floor(_) + 1
1
```

Segments sequence:
- Segment #1:
  - 250 Bite

```python
>>> from src.max_utils import segPrint as s
>>> s(250 * 1, 250)
Seg: 1 | Extra: 0 dmg | Total: 250 dmg
```

> Using `DefCPM = 0.8` and `250` HP per segment, the damage **is correct!**
