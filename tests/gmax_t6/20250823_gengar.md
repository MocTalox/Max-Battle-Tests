# Gengar

Gengar was available in T6 Gigantamax Battles on August 23rd and 24th globaly during the *Go Fest: Max Finale* event.

## Result

Gengar has the same CPM as last time, but the HP value is still unknow:

- CPM: `0.85`
- AtkMult: `0.9`
- AtkCPM: `0.765`

It is thought that its HP has been changed since last time as most of the other Gigantamax bosses during this event.
