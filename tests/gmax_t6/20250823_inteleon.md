# Inteleon

Inteleon was available in T6 Gigantamax Battles on August 23rd and 24th globaly during the *Go Fest: Max Finale* event.

## Result

Unfortunately no tests were done for Inteleon this time. The aproach has been to approximate the AtkCPM by analysing videos. With a rough estimate of the damage done by the attacks, the results will be less accurate but still enough to give us an idea of the potential stats. This way we found Inteleon has an AtkCPM in the range `0.795321` - `0.828863`, which means it has the same CPM as last time, but the HP value is still unknow:

- CPM: `0.9`
- AtkMult: `0.9`
- AtkCPM: `0.81`

It is thought that its HP has been changed since last time as most of the other Gigantamax bosses during this event.

## Attack CPM tests

**Spread NWB Shadow Ball vs Lvl40 15/13/10 Venusaur** ([battle](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/GHrqGCtdjLs))

Damage: 70 to 72 dmg

```python
>>> 0.5 * 100 * (262 + 15) / ((189 + 13) * 0.7903)
86.75737876204424
>>> from src.max_utils import mult
>>> mult((70, 72), _)
(0.7953214007220216, 0.8299005920577618)
```

> AtkCPM range = `0.795321` - `0.829901`

*Note: Lvl3 Max Guard gives +60 base hp*

```python
>>> 0.5 * 100 * (262 + 15) / ((292 + 15) * 0.8403) * 2
107.37595267085084
>>> from src.max_utils import mult
>>> mult((86, 89), _)

```

> AtkCPM range = `0.791611` - `0.828863`
