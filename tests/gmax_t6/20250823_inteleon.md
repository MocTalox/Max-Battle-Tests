# Inteleon

Inteleon was available in T6 Gigantamax Battles on August 23rd and 24th globaly during the *Go Fest: Max Finale* event.

Unfortunately no tests were done for Inteleon this time. The aproach has been to approximate the Attack CPM value by analysing videos. With a rough estimate of the damage done by the attacks, the results will be less accurate but still enough to give us an idea of the potential stats.

## Summary

Inteleon has an Attack CPM value in the range `0.795322` - `0.828863`, which means it has the same CPM as [last time](./20250612_inteleon.md), but the HP value is still unknow:

Stats     | Values
:-------- | :------
HP        | `???`
CPM       | `0.9`
*AtkMult* | `0.9`
*DefMult* | `???`
*AtkCPM*  | `0.81`
*DefCPM*  | `???`

It is thought that its HP has been changed since last time as most of the other Gigantamax bosses during this event.
