# Snorlax

Snorlax was available in T6 Gigantamax Battles on August 23rd and 24th globaly during the *Go Fest: Max Finale* event.

## Summary

Snorlax has received a nerf to its CPM since [last time](./20250419_snorlax.md). Snorlax has an Attack CPM value in the range `0.583238` - `0.586549`, which means it has a CPM of `0.65` and the same Attack Multiplier. However the HP value is still unknow:

Stats     | Values
:-------- | :------
HP        | `???`
CPM       | `0.65`
*AtkMult* | `0.9`
*DefMult* | `???`
*AtkCPM*  | `0.585`
*DefCPM*  | `???`

It is thought that its HP has been changed since last time as most of the other Gigantamax bosses during this event.
