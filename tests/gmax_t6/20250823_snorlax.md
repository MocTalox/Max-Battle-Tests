# Snorlax

Snorlax was available in T6 Gigantamax Battles on August 23rd and 24th globaly during the *Go Fest: Max Finale* event.

## Result

Snorlax got a CPM nerf, it has an AtkCPM in the range `0.583237` - `0.586550`, which means it has a CPM of `0.65` and AtkMult of `0.9`. However the HP value is still unknow:

- CPM: `0.65`
- AtkMult: `0.9`
- AtkCPM: `0.585`

It is thought that its HP has been changed since last time as most of the other Gigantamax bosses during this event.
