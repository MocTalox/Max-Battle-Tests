# Lapras

Lapras was available in T6 Gigantamax Battles on August 23rd and 24th globaly during the *Go Fest: Max Finale* event.

## Result

Lapras has the same CPM as **the first** time (reverting the massive nerf of the second time), but the HP value is still unknow:

- CPM: `0.85`
- AtkMult: `0.9`
- AtkCPM: `0.765`

It is thought that its HP has been changed since last time as most of the other Gigantamax bosses during this event.

## Attack verification tests

**Spread NWB Surf vs Lvl50 15/14/12 Charizard**

Health: [115/166 hp (51 dmg)](../../res/lapras_01.png)

```python
>>> 0.5 * 60 * ((165 + 15) * 0.765) / ((173 + 14) * 0.8403) * 1.2 * 1.6
50.47547953652916
>>> floor(_) + 1
51
```

> Using `AtkCPM = 0.765`, the damage **is correct!**
