# Kingler

Kingler was available in T6 Gigantamax Battles on August 23rd and 24th globaly during the *Go Fest: Max Finale* event.

## Summary

Kingler has the same CPM as [last time](./20250201_kingler.md), but the HP value is still unknow:

Stats     | Values
:-------- | :------
HP        | `???`
CPM       | `0.85`
*AtkMult* | `0.9`
*DefMult* | `???`
*AtkCPM*  | `0.765`
*DefCPM*  | `???`

It is thought that its HP has been changed since last time as most of the other Gigantamax bosses during this event.
